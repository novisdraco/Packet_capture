# Note: The following modules are built into Python and don't need installation:
# - ipaddress (IP address handling)
# - socket (network operations)  
# - struct (binary data handling)
# - threading (concurrent processing)
# - queue (thread-safe queues)
# - collections (deque, defaultdict)
# - datetime, time (date/time handling)
# - json (JSON serialization)
# - logging (logging framework)
# - typing (type hints)

# Browser-based dependencies (included via CDN, no pip installation needed):
# - D3.js v7.8.5 (network topology visualization)
# - Socket.IO client v4.0.1 (real-time communication)

# Installation Instructions:
# 1. Install core dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 2. For YARA support (advanced threat detection):
#    pip install yara-python==4.3.1
#
# 3. For development tools:
#    Uncomment the development dependencies above and reinstall

# Platform Notes:
# - Windows: May require Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools for some packages
# - Linux: May need sudo privileges for packet capture (run with sudo)
# - macOS: May need sudo privileges for packet capture (run with sudo)

# Performance Notes:
# - eventlet provides high-performance async networking
# - psutil enables efficient system resource monitoring  
# - numpy optimizes numerical computations for network analysis
# - Built-in collections.deque provides O(1) append/pop operations
# - Threading enables concurrent packet processing

# Security Notes:
# - All dependencies are from official PyPI with pinned versions
# - No external network dependencies required for core functionality
# - Raw socket operations require elevated privileges (Administrator/sudo)
